# Life at Gojek on My First 3 Year
---

Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I want to share my experiences working at Gojek in my first three years. There are so many new things that I got at every step of my journey. Here we go!

First of all, actually, I'm not joining Gojek like the normal `submit resume -> interview -> offering -> join Gojek`, it's not! I'm joining Gojek via acquisition hehe. Originally I worked for Moka, a Point of sales application in Indonesia, and then Moka was acquired by Gojek.

After being acquired by Gojek, I'm still working for Moka and collaborating with the Gojek team, and then becoming a team. I'm in a team that handles Open API for merchants. For my first time working in Gojek, I felt culture shock since there are too many differences when working at Moka and at Gojek. I think this is common things for everyone who joins Gojek via acquisition and my colleague from Gojek (who join via acquisition) also felt the same way before. Why did I feel culture shock? Probably this is because we are not joining as new employees in a company, but like working in two different companies and should get to use in the transition period. This is not easy to deal with culture shock, we have to change our behavior to work gradually in a half year. But somehow I can manage it hehe.

Not long after acquired, there is a laid-off announcement that makes me anxious. That is not funny if I just join Gojek and laid off. Fortunately, we from Moka are not included in the laid-off.

Let's talk about culture. After having culture shock experiences I'm feeling the culture in Gojek is good and gradually fits with me. First, we have unlimited leave. Second, how we handle day-to-day & sprint is mature enough and not strict but has priority. Third, everyone on the team was so supportive. Those are three keys that I learn to have a work-life balance, have a better mind map to prioritize tasks, and how handle incidents / any issues in staging & production.

Unlimited leave doesn't mean 100% you are able to take leaves anytime haha. We still have a sense of ownership of our product and accountability for our work, so we will take leave just when we need it. i.e we got sick and need sick leave, we have urgent errands to do, and regular leaves. For non-urgent leaves usually, we just need to inform when we will take leaves on we have Sprint planning.

Handle day-to-day & sprint is mature enough and not strict but has priority. In my observation, mostly on Gojek merchant PDGs have similar patterns to running their day-to-day work like how we communicate with another team and another PDG, how do we stand up, etc. Let's talk about standup, actually, we have common standup like `what did we do yesterday? what we will do today? and what blockers or issues?`. On standup mostly I like how the manager or leader gives feedback if there is any blocker/issue, they could give an opinion or solution or maybe help to communicate with stakeholders if needed to resolve ASAP. Besides that, when we collaborate with another team or PDG usually each team has its `support channel` for requests, asking, announcing issues, etc also we have Jira for our ticket management. Oh ya, we have a bi-weekly sprint, and here usually sprints have Retro and Planning. Retro is for reviewing our last Sprint to know What is going good, bad and what action we can do. Planning is planning what we do in the next sprint, usually designed by leaders but members are also able to give ideas for what we can improve or what we can do in this sprint. Any ideas are open and not limited as far as it's still on our project scope. Of course, the ideas not included in the sprint immediately, remember we have to prioritize our tasks and fit with our OKR.

Everyone on the team is supportive, this is key to the most beautiful things in the team. Just like it is, each member supports the others. How do we support others?
1. When we have a block or issue, we usually discuss and find solutions together in a discussion.
2. When we don't understand how to do something and need to explain it to another team or stakeholder, anyone is open to sharing their knowledge to help me to understand. Even if it needs time to get to the point.
3. When we have urgency or sick or unavailable, anyone in the team is ready to help without `blaming or saying anything no good or finger pointing to anyone`.
With this kind of work environment, of course I really feel enjoy working in Gojek. Gojek has positive vibes overall so I can release my 100% to work but not feel like working (just kidding).


I think that's all that I can share on this post. Actually, there is still so much I want to tell, but let's save it for another post hehe. I'm here in Gojek and still enjoy learning something new and big, hope I can share it with you. Thank you for reading! see you!

# Life at Gojek on My First 3 Year
---

Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I want to share my experiences working at Gojek in my first 3 year. There is so many new thing that I got in every step in my journey. Here we go!

First of all, actually I'm not join Gojek like normal `submit resume -> interview -> offering -> join Gojek`, it's not! I'm join Gojek via acquisition hehe. Originally I worked for MOKA, Point of sales application in Indonesia.

After acquired by Gojek, I'm still working for Moka and collaborate with Gojek team. Oh,Moka Open Api team

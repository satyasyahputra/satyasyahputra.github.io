# Life at Gojek on My First 3 Year
---

Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I want to share my experiences working at Gojek in my first 3 year. There is so many new thing that I got in every step in my journey. Here we go!

First of all, actually I'm not join Gojek like normal `submit resume -> interview -> offering -> join Gojek`, it's not! I'm join Gojek via acquisition hehe. Originally I worked for Moka, Point of sales application in Indonesia and then Moka acquired by Gojek.

After acquired by Gojek, I'm still working for Moka and collaborate with Gojek team then become a team. I'm in team which handle Open API for merchants. For my first time work in Gojek, I felt culture-shock since there is too many differences when work at Moka and at Gojek. I think this is common things for everyone who join Gojek via acquisition and my colleague from Gojek (which join via acquisition) also felt same way before. Why I felt culture-shock? Probably this is because we are not join as new employee in a company, but like working in two different company and should be get to used in transition period. This is not easy to deal with culture-shock, we have to change our behavior to work gradually in a half year. But somehow I can manage it ðŸ¤ž hehe. 

Not long after acquired, there is a laid off announcement ðŸ˜± make me anxious. That is not funny, if I just join Gojek and laid off ðŸ˜…. Fortunately, we from Moka is not included on laid off.

Let's talk about culture, after has culture-shock experiences I'm feeling the culture in Gojek is good and gradually fit with me. First one, we have unlimited leave. Second one, how we handle day-to-day & sprint is mature enough and not strict, but have priority. Third one, everyone in team so supportive. Those are three key what I learn to have work-life balance, have better mind map to prioritize task, and how handle incident / any issues in staging & production.

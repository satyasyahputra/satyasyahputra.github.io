# Life at Gojek on My First 3 Year
---

Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I want to share my experiences working at Gojek in my first 3 year. There is so many new thing that I got in every step in my journey. Here we go!

First of all, actually I'm not join Gojek like normal `submit resume -> interview -> offering -> join Gojek`, it's not! I'm join Gojek via acquisition hehe. Originally I worked for Moka, Point of sales application in Indonesia and then Moka acquired by Gojek.

After acquired by Gojek, I'm still working for Moka and collaborate with Gojek team then become a team. I'm in team which handle Open API for merchants. For my first time work in Gojek, I felt culture-shock since there is too many differences when work at Moka and at Gojek. I think this is common things for everyone who join Gojek via acquisition and my colleague from Gojek (which join via acquisition) also felt same way before. Why I felt culture-shock? Probably this is because we are not join as new employee in a company, but like working in two different company and should be get to used in transition period. This is not easy to deal with culture-shock, we have to change our behavior to work gradually in a half year. But somehow I can manage it hehe. 

Not long after acquired, there is a laid off announcement make me anxious. That is not funny, if I just join Gojek and laid off. Fortunately, we from Moka is not included on laid off.

Let's talk about culture, after has culture-shock experiences I'm feeling the culture in Gojek is good and gradually fit with me. First one, we have unlimited leave. Second one, how we handle day-to-day & sprint is mature enough and not strict, but have priority. Third one, everyone in team so supportive. Those are three key what I learn to have work-life balance, have better mind map to prioritize task, and how handle incident / any issues in staging & production.

Unlimited leave doesn't mean 100% you able to be take leaves anytime haha. We still have sense of ownership of our product and accountability of our works, so we will take leaves just whwn we need it. i.e we got sick and need sick leave, we have urgency errands to do and regular leaves. For non urgency leaves usually we just need to inform when we will take leaves on we have Sprint planning.

Handle day-to-day & sprint is mature enough and not strict, but have priority. On my observation, mostly on Gojek merchant PDG have similar pattern to run their day-to-day works like how we communicate with another team and another PDG, how do we do stand up, etc. Let's talk about standup, actually we have common standup like `what did we do yesterday? what we will do today? and what blockers or issues?`. On standup mostly I like how manager or leader giving feedback if there any blocker/issue, they could give opinion or solution or maybe help to communicate with stakeholder if needed to resolve ASAP. Besides that, when we have collaborate with another team or PDG usually each team have their `support channel` for request, asking, announce issues, etc also we have Jira for our ticket management. Oh ya, we have bi-weekly sprint and here usually sprint which have Retro and Planning. Retro is for review our last Sprint to know What is going good, bad and what action we can do. Planning is plan what we do in the next sprint, usually design by leaders but members also able to give ideas for what we can improve or what we can do in this sprint. Any ideas is open and not limited as far as it's still on our project scope, of course the ideas not include in sprint immediately, remember we have to prioritize our tasks and fit with our OKR. 

Everyone in the team is supportive, this key the most beautiful things in the team. Just like it is, each member support each others. How do we support each others?
1. When we have block or issue, we usually discuss and find solution together in a discussions.
2. When we doesn't understand how to something and need to explain to another team or stakeholder, anyone is open to share their knowledge to help me to understand. Even it is need time to get the point.
3. When we have urgency or sick or unavailable, anyone in team is ready to help witout `blaming or saying anything no good or finger pointing to anyone`.
With this kind of work environtment, of course I'm really feel enjoy to work in Gojek. Gojek have positive vibes overall so I can release my 100% to work but not feeling like work (just kidding).


I think that's all what I can share on this post, actually there is still so much I want to tell, but let's save it for another post hehe. I'm here in Gojek still enjoy to learn something new and big, hope I can share it to you. Thank you for reading! see you!
